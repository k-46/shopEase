## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/k-46/shopEase
cd shopEase
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🎨 Design Choices

### State Management
- Utilized React's built-in `useState` hook for state management
- Implemented a simple and efficient cart state structure


### UI/UX Decisions
- **Modal Design**: 
  - Used custom modal implementation for better control over animations and behavior
  - Added smooth transitions for opening/closing animations

- **Cart Features**:
  - Minimum quantity of 1 to prevent accidental item removal
  - Clear visual feedback for cart updates
  - Real-time total calculation

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient array operations using `reduce()` for cart calculations
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management
- Lazy loading of product images

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Key Components
- `App.jsx`: Main application component managing cart state and layout
- `ProductCard.jsx`: Individual product display with add to cart functionality
- `Cart.jsx`: Shopping cart modal with item management
- `ProductModal.jsx`: Detailed product view

### State Management
```javascript
// Cart state structure
const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState([]);

// Efficient cart calculations
const itemCount = cartItems.reduce((total, item) => total + item.quantity, 0);
```

## 🎯 Challenges & Solutions
